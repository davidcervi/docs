**1. Are my students visible to other tutors?**
No, absolutely not. TutorOS is not a marketplace for connecting students with tutors. It is a platform designed for private tutors to manage lessons with their own students.

**2. What types of lessons are supported?**
We currently support one-on-one lessons. Group lesson support is coming soon!

**3. Does TutorOS take a commission on each lesson fee?**
No! You will receive the full amount of your lesson fee. If the student pays online using their debit or credit card, a small payment processing fee will be added to the total amount charged to the student.
