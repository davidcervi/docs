### General Questions

**1. Are my students visible to other tutors?**
No, absolutely not. TutorOS is not a marketplace for connecting students with tutors. It is a platform designed for private tutors to manage lessons with their own students.

**2. What types of lessons are supported?**
We currently support one-on-one lessons. Group lesson support is coming soon!
