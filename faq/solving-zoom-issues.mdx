### Pop-Up Blockers

If you are using Zoom from your browser, and you have installed pop-up blockers on your browser, then Zoom may fail to
successfully launch when you join a lesson. You can easily resolve this by allowing pop-ups for Zoom. Here's how to do it:

#### Chrome
1. Click the three dots in the upper-right corner, go to **Settings** > **Privacy and security** > **Site settings** > **Pop-ups and redirects**.
2. Under **Allowed to send pop-ups and use redirects**, click **Add**, and enter `zoom.us` to allow pop-ups.

#### Firefox
1. Click the menu button, go to **Settings** > **Privacy & Security**.
2. Under **Permissions**, locate **Block pop-up windows** and click **Exceptions**.
3. Enter `zoom.us` and click **Allow** to whitelist Zoom.

#### Safari
1. Go to **Safari** > **Preferences** > **Websites** > **Pop-up Windows**.
2. Find `zoom.us` in the list and select **Allow**.

### Audio Issues

If Zoom audio is not working, click the `Join Audio` button on the bottom-left corner of the Zoom window:

- The headphone icon indicates that the audio is not connected. Click `Join Audio` to connect to the audio.
- If the audio is muted after being connected, click `Unmute`.
- A microphone icon without a red slash (as shown in the last icon in the image above) means your mic is active and functioning correctly.
- If you are using a headset, join audio first before connecting your headset.
