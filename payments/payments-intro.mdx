   - **Late Cancellation:** If canceled less than 24 hours before the session, 50% of the lesson cost is charged.

2. **Moderate**
   - **Cancellation Window:** Cancellations allowed up to 48 hours before the session.
   - **Refund:** Full refund if canceled within the allowed window.
   - **Late Cancellation:** 50% charge if canceled between 24-48 hours; full charge if canceled less than 24 hours before.

3. **Strict**
   - **Cancellation Window:** Cancellations allowed up to 72 hours before the session.
   - **Refund:** Full refund if canceled within the allowed window.
   - **Late Cancellation:** No refund if canceled less than 72 hours before the session.
