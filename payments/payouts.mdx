### How Payouts Work

For lessons payments that are made inside TutorOS, your balance will accumulate and is paid out (i.e. transferred to your connected bank account) daily.
Our payment provider, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/connect), also requires a brief “rolling” hold period before those funds transfer to your bank. The exact hold period depends on where your bank account is located:

- **United States**: Daily payouts, funds paid out 2 days after after a lesson payment is made.
- **UK & EU Countries**: Daily payouts, funds paid out 7 days after after a lesson payment is made.
- **UAE**: Daily payouts, funds paid out 7 days after after a lesson payment is made.
- **All Other Countries**: Daily payouts, funds paid out 3 days after a lesson payment is made.
