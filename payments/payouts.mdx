### How Payouts Work

For lessons payments that are made inside TutorOS, your balance will accumulate and is paid out (i.e. transferred to your connected bank account) daily for UK and EU bank accounts and every Wednesday for accounts in all other countries.

### Viewing Payouts

If you are using a UK or EU bank account, you can view your payouts in your Stripe Connect account:

If you are using a bank account in all other countries, you can view your payouts in the [Billing](https://platform.tutoros.app/billing) section in TutorOS.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1. How long do payments take to reach my bank account?**
Payouts to US, Canada, UK and EU bank accounts arrive the same day. For other countries, delivery typically takes 1-3 days.

**2. Am I charged a fee for each payout?**
No. You will receive the full amount of your balance each time it is transferred to your bank account.
