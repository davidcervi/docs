In order to receive payments for your lessons, you need to first connect your bank account to TutorOS.

## Online Payments

To connect your bank account for online lesson payments, go to the [Billing](https://platform.tutoros.app/billing) section in the app and click the `Connect Bank Account` button:

You will then see the following pop-up, where you are required to set the country where you are based. This should be the country in which your bank account, used for receiving lesson payments, is located. See [here](/payments/payouts#frequently-asked-questions-faq) for the full list of supported countries where tutors can receive payments.

You will be redirected to the [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/connect) onboarding page. Stripe Connect is the platform that TutorOS uses to manage online lesson payments to tutors. You will then be prompted to enter your bank account details to complete the setup process.

## Bank Transfer Payments

If you want to allow students to pay after lessons via bank transfer, you can add your bank information to TutorOS and it will be shared with students after each lesson.

To do this, go to the [Billing](https://platform.tutoros.app/billing) section in the app and click the `Add Bank Details` button.
