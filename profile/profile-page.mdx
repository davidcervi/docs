## Profile Page Introduction

Your profile page serves as a unique landing page where students can view your details and book lessons with you. You can share the link to your profile directly with your students (via SMS, WhatsApp, etc.) or post it online wherever you promote your tutoring services.

## Viewing & Sharing Page

To view your page, click the `My Link` link in the toolbar:

![Profile Page 1](/images/profile-page-1.png)

You will then be directed to the `My Link` section, where you can view your unique profile link, ready to be copied and shared with students or posted online.

Additionally, you can invite students to your page by clicking the `Invite Students` button, allowing you to enter the email addresses of the students you wish to invite.

Clicking your profile page link will open your profile, displaying your details along with the [lesson templates](/templates/lesson-template-intro) you have created in your account:

## Embedding Page on your Website

If you already have a website where students currently book lessons, you can embed your profile page directly by using your `Embed Code`.

This allows you to seamlessly embed the your TutorOS profile page as a drop-in replacement for your existing booking form on your website.

If you feel that displaying your profile info (image, name and bio) on your page is redundant, you can use the `hideProfile` query parameter to display only your lesson templates on your page:

![Profile Page 5](/images/profile-page-5.png)

The `hideProfile` query param must be added to the `src` attribute in your embed code. So, for example, if your `Link URL` is `https://platform.tutoros.app/amyjones`, then your embed code should be changed to:

```javascript
<iframe
  src="https://platform.tutoros.app/amyjones?hideProfile=true"
  width="100%"
  height="100%"
  style="border:none; overflow:hidden;"
  scrolling="yes"
  allowfullscreen
  loading="lazy">
</iframe>
```

Below are instructions on how to embed your code in some of the most common website platforms:

4. Paste your iframe code into the Custom HTML block.
5. Preview or update the page to confirm the embed displays correctly.

### Wix

1. Log in to your Wix account and open your site in the Wix Editor.
2. On the left side, click the “Add” (+)” button.
3. From the menu, select “Embed” (or “Embed Code” or “Custom Embeds” depending on your Wix version).
4. Choose “Custom Embeds” → “Embed a Widget” (Wix might name it slightly differently).
5. A box will appear on your page. Click inside it to open the HTML settings panel.
6. Paste your iframe code into the provided field.

1. Log in to Squarespace and navigate to the page or section where you want to embed the code.
