### Profile Page Introduction

Your profile page serves as a unique landing page where students can view your details and book lessons with you. You can share the link to your profile directly with your students or post it online wherever you promote your tutoring services.

### Viewing & Sharing Profile Page

To view your page, click on your name on the top right of the toolbar and then click `My Link` in the dropdown:

You will then be directed to the `My Link` section, where you can view your unique profile link, ready to be copied and shared with students or posted online. Additionally, you can invite students to your page by clicking the `Invite Students` button, allowing you to enter the email addresses of the students you wish to invite.
