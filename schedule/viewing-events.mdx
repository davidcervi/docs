### Viewing Lesson Events

When a student books a new lesson, the lesson is added as an event to your schedule:

![Lesson Event 1](/images/lesson-event-1.png)

You can then view the lesson details by clicking on the event:

![Lesson Event 2](/images/lesson-event-2.png)

<Note>When a lesson is booked, the lesson time is reserved in your calendar and no other lessons can be booked for that same time.</Note>
