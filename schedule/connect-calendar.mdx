## Overview

In TutorOS, you can connect an external calendar (such as your Gmail or Outlook calendar) so that events from this calendar are automatically displayed in your TutorOS schedule.

This feature is useful for identifying available time slots around external events, such as university lectures, personal engagements, etc.

Once you connect an calendar, TutorOS will also automatically add any future lesson events to your calendar.

## How to Connect Your Calendar

To connect your calendar, go to the [Schedule](https://platform.tutoros.app/schedule) section in TutorOS and click the `Connect Your Calendar` button:
