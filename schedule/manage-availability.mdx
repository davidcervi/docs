### Schedule Introduction

The [Schedule](https://platform.tutoros.app/schedule) section is where you select which times you are available for students to book
lessons with you.


### Add Availability Slot

To add a new availability slot for a time range during which youâ€™re available for lessons, click on the desired time slot in the calendar, or click and drag from the start time to the end time:

In the pop-up that appears, you can adjust the start and end times of the slot. If you would like the slot to be recurring (for example, if you're available for bookings 
every Wednesday from 6 pm to 9 pm), simply check the `Recurring` box. You can then click the `Save` button to create the slot:

The availability slot is then displayed as an event in the calendar with a light purple background:

When a lesson is booked, the lesson time is reserved in your calendar and no other lessons can be booked for that same time.

### Delete Availability Slot

If you want to delete an availability slot, you can click the event in your schedule and then click the `Delete Event` button:

For availability slots that are recurring, you can either delete the slot just for that specific day or delete the entire recurring series. To delete the slot for just that day, click the `Delete Event` button. To delete the entire series, click the `Delete Recurring Series` button.
