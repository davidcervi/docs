### Schedule Introduction

The [Schedule](https://platform.tutoros.app/schedule) section is where you select which times you are available for students to book
lessons with you.


### Add Availability Slot

To add a new availability slot for a time range during which youâ€™re available for lessons, click on the desired time slot in the calendar, or click and drag from the start time to the end time:

![Add Availability 1](/images/add-availability-1.png)

In the pop-up that appears, you can adjust the start and end times of the slot. If you would like the slot to be recurring (for example, if you're available for bookings every Wednesday from 6 pm to 9 pm), simply check the `Recurring` box.

When a lesson is booked, the lesson time is reserved in your calendar and no other lessons can be booked for that same time.
