### How lesson cancellations work

**Student Cancellations:**

If the student cancels a lesson, then one of the following will happen, depending on the lesson [cancellation policy](/templates/create-new-template#cancellation-policy) and how long before the lesson they cancel:

| **Cancellation Policy** | **Cancellation Window**    | **If Paid At Booking**         | **If Paid After Lesson**     |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Flexible**            | 24+ hours before session  | Full refund                    | No penalty fee               |
| **Flexible**            | Less than 24 hours        | 50% refund                    | 50% penalty fee              |

**Tutor Cancellations:**

If you cancel a lesson, then if the student has already paid, they will be sent a full refund. If they have not already paid, then no payment for the lesson will be due.

### How to cancel a lesson

Either you or the student may cancel a lesson. The cancellation process, described below, is the same for both you and the student.

**1.** Click the ellipsis (three dots) on the top right of the box for the lesson you want to cancel:

**5.** The The lesson will be removed from your schedule, and the time of the lesson will be freed up so another lesson can be booked for that time. 
Also, If you have connected one or more external calendars, then the lesson event will be removed from each calendar.
