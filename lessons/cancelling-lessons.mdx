## How Lesson Cancellations Work

### Student Cancellations

If the student cancels a lesson, then depending on the lesson [cancellation policy](/templates/create-new-template#cancellation-policy) and when they cancel, one of the following will apply:

- A full refund will be issued.
- A partial refund will be issued.
- No refund will be issued.
- Notified that the full lesson payment is now due.
- Notified that a partial lesson payment is now due.
- Notified that no payment is due.

If the lesson was booked from a lesson package, then the remaining lesson count for that package will be increased by one.

### Tutor Cancellations

If you cancel a lesson, then if the student has already paid, they will be sent a full refund. If they have not already paid, then no payment for the lesson will be due.

If the lesson was booked from a lesson package, then the remaining lesson count for that package will be increased by one.

## How to Cancel a Lesson

Either you or the student may cancel a lesson. The cancellation process, described below, is the same for both you and the student.

**1.** Click the ellipsis (three dots) on the top right of the box for the lesson you want to cancel:

**2.** Then click the Cancel option that appears:

![Cancel Lesson 2](/images/cancel-lesson-2.png)

**3.** You will then see a final confirmation pop-up to confirm whether or not to cancel the lesson:

**4.** Once the lesson is cancelled, a Cancelled status will be displayed beside the lesson in your lesson list:

**5.** The lesson will then be removed from your schedule, and the time of the lesson will be freed up so another lesson can be booked for that time. 
Also, If you have connected one or more external calendars, then the lesson event will be removed from each calendar.
