## How Lesson Cancellations Work

### Student Cancellations

If the student cancels a lesson, the outcome will depend on the lesson [cancellation policy](/templates/create-new-template#cancellation-policy), the timing of the cancellation, and whether the lesson was booked as part of a lesson package. Based on these factors, one of the following will apply:

- A full refund, partial refund, or no refund will be issued.
- The student will be notified whether the full lesson payment, a partial payment, or no payment is due.
- If the lesson was booked as part of a lesson package, the remaining lesson count for that package will be increased by one.

### Tutor Cancellations

If you cancel a lesson, then one of the following will apply:

- If the student has already paid, they will be sent a full refund. 
- If the student has not already paid, then no payment for the lesson will be due.
- If the lesson was booked as part of a lesson package, the remaining lesson count for that package will be increased by one.

## How to Cancel a Lesson

Either you or the student may cancel a lesson. The cancellation process, described below, is the same for both you and the student.

**1.** Click the ellipsis (three dots) on the top right of the box for the lesson you want to cancel:

**2.** Then click the Cancel option that appears:

![Cancel Lesson 2](/images/cancel-lesson-2.png)

**3.** You will then see a final confirmation pop-up to confirm whether or not to cancel the lesson:

**4.** Once the lesson is cancelled, a Cancelled status will be displayed beside the lesson in your lesson list:

**5.** The lesson will then be removed from your schedule, and the time of the lesson will be freed up so another lesson can be booked for that time. 
Also, If you have connected one or more external calendars, then the lesson event will be removed from each calendar.
