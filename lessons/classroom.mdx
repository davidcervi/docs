## Introduction

All lessons on TutorOS takes place in our virtual classoom. Once you enter the classroom, the Zoom call for the lesson will automatically open.

Each section of the classroom is described below.

## Sections

### Class Notes Editor

This is the editor where you can take notes throughout the lesson. The editor is interactive as the student also has access to the classroom, allowing them to see the notes you add in real time and contribute their own notes as well.

The class notes editor is a fully featured rich text editor, allowing you to highlight text, apply formatting, create lists & tables, upload images & files, add math equations, among other options.

You can read more about our class notes editor features [here](/lessons/classroom#class-notes-editor-features).

### Whiteboard

The whiteboard is a collaborative canvas where you can create drawings throughout the lesson. Just like the class notes editor, it’s interactive—students can see your drawings in real time and contribute their own.

The whiteboard lets you draw freehand, add sticky notes, illustrate concepts with shapes and connectors, and more.

### Slash commands

The slash commands feature lets you execute a predefined command by writing its name or alias directly in the editor. This is useful for when you quickly want to add a new block quote, heading, bulleted list, etc.

When you type a slash (/), the suggested commands are displayed in a panel next to it. You can also type a phrase after the / to filter the results in the panel and to easily find the desired command.

## Best Practices

Once the lesson concludes and you leave the classroom, the class notes and whiteboard will be locked and cannot be edited further. Therefore, we recommend making any final adjustments or cleanups at the end of the lesson (after the Zoom session has ended) and before you exit the classroom.
