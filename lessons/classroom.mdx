## Classroom Introduction

The TutorOS classroom consists of the following sections:

- `Class Notes`. This is the editor where you can take notes throughout the lesson. The student also has access to the classroom, allowing them to see the notes you add in real time and contribute their own notes as well.
- `Lesson Info`. This section provides basic information about the lesson, including the student’s name and the lesson time.
- `Resource`. The resource selected for this lesson.
- `Student Notes`. This section displays any notes the student added before the lesson. For example, a student might write a note such as, “In this lesson, I would like to focus on irregular Spanish verbs.”

## Class Notes Editor

The class notes editor is a fully featured rich text editor, allowing you to highlight text, apply bold or italic formatting, and create bulleted or numbered lists, among other options.

### Rich Text

To access the rich text features, select a portion of text to display the rich text toolbar or use the keyboard shortcuts listed below.

### Slash commands

The slash commands feature lets you execute a predefined command by writing its name or alias directly in the editor. This is useful for when you quickly want to add a new block quote, heading, bulleted list, etc.
When you type a slash (/), the suggested commands are displayed in a panel next to it. You can also type a phrase after the / to filter the results in the panel and to easily find the desired command.

### Best Practices

Once the lesson concludes and you leave the classroom, the class notes will be locked and cannot be edited further. Therefore, we recommend making any final adjustments or cleanups at the end of the lesson (after the Zoom session has ended) and before you exit the classroom.
