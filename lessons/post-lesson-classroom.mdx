## Overview

Once a lesson ends, you can view the lesson class notes, summary, transcript and recording in the classroom for this lesson. Each one is described below:

## Sections

### Class Notes

The class notes that you added throughout this lesson. These will be locked and therefore can't be edited.

### Summary

The summary of this lesson. This is generated by TutorOS using AI (Artifical Intelligence), based on the lesson transcript and class notes. This is helpful to use as an aid when [leaving feedback](/lessons/leaving-feedback) to the student for this lesson.

### Transcript

The transcript of the lesson. The transcript can help you review your lesson, assess how well students understood the material, identify specific areas where students struggled and address them in future lessons, and help you when [leaving feedback](/lessons/leaving-feedback) for this lesson.

TutorOS generates accurate transcripts for lessons in 30+ languages, and can also handle code switching between any of these languages, meaning our transcripts work for language learning lessons (e.g. a Spanish lesson where the language of instruction is English).
