### Adding Resources

A Lesson Resource is an optional document that you can add to an upcoming lesson. It will then be displayed in the [classroom](/lessons/classroom) so you can easily read through it with the student during the lesson.

Lesson Resources can either be a PDF file or a Word doc, e.g. an article, a sample math paper, etc.

To add a resource to an upcoming lesson, click the Upload link in the lesson box:
