### Leaving Feedback

Once a lesson ends, you can give the student feedback on what they did well in the lesson and how they can improve.

After the lesson, you will receive an email with a link to submit your feedback:

You can also submit feedback from the [Lessons](https://platform.tutoros.app/lessons?filter=previous) screen:

On the Feedback screen, complete the two fields and click the `Submit` button to send your feedback:

The student will be notified once your feedback is ready and will be able to view it.
