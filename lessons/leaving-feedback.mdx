### Leaving Feedback

Once the summary, transcript and recording for a completed lesson have been generated, you will be notified via email:

![Give Feedback 1](/images/give-feedback-1.png)

The email will contain a link to the feedback form. You can also access the feedback form by clicking the `Give Feedback` button for a lesson in your [Previous Lessons](https://platform.tutoros.app/lessons?filter=previous):

The Feedback screen contains the feeback form, consisting of two questions:

1. What did the student do well?
2. How can the student continue to improve?

The lesson summary, transcript, class notes, whiteboard and recording (see [here](/lessons/post-lesson-classroom) for more details) are also provided, which you can use as an aid when filling out your feedback.

You can fill out the two fields and then click the `Submit` button to submit your feedback.

The student will then be notified via email and will be able to view the feedback (both in the email and in the student portal).
