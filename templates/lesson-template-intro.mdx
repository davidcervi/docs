### What is a Lesson Template?

A Lesson Template defines details like the name, price, duration, payment policy and cancellation policy for a type of lesson.

When students book a lesson for a template, they are booking an individual session created from this template.

When you create a new template, it will be available in the `Single Lessons` section on your [profile page](/profile/profile-page) for students to book individual lessons for that template.

### Example

Let's say you are a Spanish and French tutor, you could create two templates,  
`1-hour Spanish Lesson` and `1-hour French Lesson`, and then students would be able to book lessons in either of these from your profile page (based on your [availability](/schedule/add-availability)):
