### View Your Packages

To open the action menu for a package, click the gear icon in the top right corner of the package box. This will show the options to edit, archive or delete a package:

### Edit Package

To edit a package, click on the `Edit package` link, which will take you to the Edit Package screen.

You can edit all settings for a package apart from the template it is linked to.

If you update the lesson count or validity period, the updated values will only apply to new purchases. The lesson count/validty period for all previous purchases will remain unchanged.

### Archive Package

To archive a package, click on the `Archive package` link. Archiving a package will hide it from your profile page, so students will no longer be able to buy this package.

### Delete Package

To delete a package, click on the `Delete package` link.

<Note>Packages that have been purchased at least once can only be archived but not deleted. </Note>
