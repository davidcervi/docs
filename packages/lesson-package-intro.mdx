### What is a Lesson Package?

A Lesson Package allows you to offer multiple lessons as a bundled purchase, providing students with a conveniant way to
purchase multiple lessons at once. Instead of booking individual lessons one at a time, students can purchase a package that grants them a set number of lessons for a specific Lesson Template.

Each Lesson Package is tied to a Lesson Template, and you can create more than one package for each of your templates.

When you create a new template, it will be available in the `Lesson Packages` section on your [profile page](/profile/profile-page) for students to purchase.

### Example

Let's say you have created one template called `1-hour Spanish Lesson`, you can then create two new packages with the following settings:

1. Lesson Count = 5. Price = €120.00
2. Lesson Count = 10. Price = €250.00
